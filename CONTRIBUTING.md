# Contributing

- Keep dependencies minimal and documented in each project's `requirements.txt`.
- Prefer CPU-friendly defaults; gate GPU-only code behind flags.
- Add dataset links (public only) with clear licenses.
- Write personable comments: explain _why_ a choice was made.
- Include a short **Repro** section in each PR.
